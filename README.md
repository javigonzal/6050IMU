"# 6050IMU" 
MPU6050 Sketch with Madgwick's implementation and adjusted functionality for my Multiple-IMU project.
Based on Kriswiner's job and Madgwick's open-source sensor fusion algorithms. 
The objective is to bring a fully operative quaternion out of multiple 6050 sensors integrated thanks to a I2C multiplexer.
Runs on 3.3V 8 MHz Pro Mini
